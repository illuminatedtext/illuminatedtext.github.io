        		<h1>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.</h1>
			<h3>by T.S. Eliot</h3>
			<h2>Illuminated Text by Manasvi Vanama and Jareeat Purnava</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Lines 6: <i><b>Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.</b></i><p>
			<p>by Jareeat (original analysis)</p>
			<br>
			<p>The recipient of this poem remains ambiguous. Many have attributed it to a woman receiving the titular character’s love, but the identity remains anonymous.</p>
      <p>The lines before, describing how the afternoon and evening sleep so peacefully, are personifications of these two entities but also indicate long days have passed between the narrator and the recipient. It seems as if they know each other well, but there is a growing sense of unease between them, as the afternoons and evening start to “malinger” - that is, fake illness. This further personifies these entities, how instead of being truly “asleep” or “tired”, they are faking it for their own benefit. This provides an intimidating tone to these lines, as if even the afternoon and evening are hovering above the narrator’s head, waiting for something disastrous to occur.</p>
      <p>The presence of a recipient further fuels the idea that there is a confession the narrator is trying to admit. The overhanging presence of the afternoon and evenings are like judgemental eyes, waiting, continually fuelling the uneasiness until he musters enough strength to confess to the recipient.</p>
