        		<h1>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.</h1>
			<h3>by T.S. Eliot</h3>
			<h2>Illuminated Text by Manasvi Vanama and Jareeat Purnava</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Lines 11-12: <i><b>"And in short, I was afraid."</b></i></p>
			<p>by Manasvi (original)</p>
			<br>
			<p>In the characters of both Prufrock and Benjamin (Ben) Braddock from The Graudate, we see that they are nervous, afraid, and very uncertain of their future.</p> 
			<p>Prufrock faces a midlife crisis, one including the balding of his head, insecurities with women, fear of making a fool of himself, and fear of death as seen in the previous line. Prufrock admits this fear as the descriptive flow of the previous lines is abruptly ended by this short statement. Prufrock wants to admit something but he cuts it off and just simply just states that he is afraid.</p>
			<p>In Ben’s story, he is nervous, afraid and worried about his future, from the moment we are introduced to the character, all the way to the last scene of the movie. Some of Ben’s first lines include him saying that he is worried about what his future will be. Throughout the movie, he is nervous and afraid as he has a secret affair with a married woman and then falls in love with her daughter. Again, in the last scene, although Ben has reached his goal of winning Elaine’s heart, he sits on the bus with her, wondering what will happen next rather than enjoying the moment.</p> 
			<p>Both these characters experience an internal struggle, focused on their present being and future. This last line is representative of their punctured, disjointed thoughts, as seen in many Modernist texts.</p>
