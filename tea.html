			<p>Afternoon tea is a historical tradition in Britain and in this poem there are quite a few mention of snacks frequently consumed during the evening and afternoon. Afternoon tea is meant to be a light activity and act as a relaxing, temporary getaway for the busy, but in this situation it acts as a contrast to when the narrator admits he has “fasted”, therefore abstained from consuming tea and cakes and ices.</p> 
			<p>From <a href="https://www.enotes.com/topics/food-literature">enotes</a>: <i>A common setting related to food in children's literature is teatime. Usually employed to dramatize states of harmony or disharmony, teatime is used to great effect in such works as Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1866), in which Alice learns to come to terms with the world around her via her experiences at the Mad Hatter's distinctly uncivilized tea party. Food and order images are also used liberally in such tales as Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows (1961), where food denotes coziness and plenty. In addition to reflecting social order and civilization, food is often representative of the limitations imposed upon a child's world, blending well with the idea of excess as a key element of childhood fantasy. For example, Maurice Sendak's In the Night Kitchen (1963) uses food as a vehicle to express strong childhood emotions, and, like many other children's texts, uses rituals of eating as a metaphor for the power struggle inherent to family dynamics.</i></p>
			<p>As the narrator repetitively states his consumption of food and drink throughout the poem, abstaining from it may mean breaking a habit or bad rituals that cause him misery.</p>
