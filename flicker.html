        		<h1>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.</h1>
			<h3>by T.S. Eliot</h3>
			<h2>Illuminated Text by Manasvi Vanama and Jareeat Purnava</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Line 12: <i><b>"I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,"</b></i><p>
			<p>by Manasvi (original analysis)</p>
			<br>
      <p>Through the analysis of this line, we can see similarities in the characteristics of a tragic and modern hero. In Shakespeare’s King Lear, we see Lear’s greatness flicker from the very first scenes when dividing the kingdom between his three daughters. Similarly, throughout the poem, we see Prufrock attempting to adapt to the new modernist society, but with fail.</p> 
      <p>Prufrock expresses his sadness that his good days and experiences are behind him and can never come back. We see a flicker in Lear’s greatness when he let’s his daughter's’ fake words of love persuade him easily while in Prufrock, this moment occurs whenever he decides to adapt into society, but in the end decides against it due to insecurities. Both share pessimistic viewpoints of their futures, while King Lear goes mad and turns into a fool when he is betrayed by his daughters, Prufrock leads a lonely, isolated life, lead by fear.</p> 
      <p>In both cases, we see two heroes, whose mindsets get the best of them, causing them to lead to a downfall and life of lonliness and sadness.</p>
