        		<h1>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.</h1>

			<p>Rationale</p> 
			<p>During the Modernism time period, there was a rejection of all religious and moral principles as science and technology advanced. This rejection was not because of a failure of belief in God, but due to doubt in the meaning and creation of life. As such, in this line, we see that our modern hero, Prufrock, is actually religious as he states that he has wept, fasted and prayed. Thus we can see that he does fit characteristics of a modern hero as he does not follow the beliefs of the rest of the society.</p> 
      <p>He does not move with the advances in science and technology, but rather against it. However, through this rebellion, he becomes isolated as he feels he is alone in his way of thinking. He believes that no one will understand or embrace him due to what he thinks are flaws.</p>
