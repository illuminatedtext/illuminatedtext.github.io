			<p><b>What Happened to John the Baptist's Head?</b></p>
			<p>From <a href="http://globalchristiancenter.com/christian-living/lesser-known-bible-people/31297-what-happened-to-john-the-baptists-head">globalchristiancenter</a></p>
			<p>John the Baptist was the son of a Priest, a Cohen.</p>
			<p>His father was Zachariah, so his proper name was not ‘John the Baptist', but Johanan Bar Zachariah Cohen.</p>
			<p>The Gospel of Mark 6:17-28 gives us this account:</p>
			<p>"For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; for he had married her.  Because John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."  Therefore Herodias held it against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not; for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and he protected him. And when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. Then an opportune day came when Herod on his birthday gave a feast for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee. And when Herodias' daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you." He also swore to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom." So she went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist!" Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter." And the king was exceedingly sorry; yet, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he did not want to refuse her. Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in prison, brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother."</p>
			<br>
			<p>Rationale</p>
			<p>John the Baptist, as described in the website above, was a preacher that is regarded as a prophet and saint in religions today, and is generally agreed upon to have baptized Jesus. The king Herod’s wife, Herodias, was divorced from Herod’s brother and John criticized Herod for unlawfully taking his brother’s wife. Due to this, Herodias held a grudge against him. At one point during Herod’s birthday, Herodias’s daughter Salome danced enchantingly before the king, and when he offered her anything she wanted, she asked for John the Baptist’s head on a plate, as ordered by her mother. The king eventually imprisoned John and executed him.</p> 
			<p>This line is interesting because before, the narrator was talking about fasting and praying, things usually done by a prophet, and yet here dismisses the notion that he is a holy individual. Instead, he compares himself to John by saying he has seen himself be slaughtered, which hints to something important having occurred previously in his life, perhaps a grudge somebody had held against him. “Growing slightly bald” is an indication of an aging body and perhaps of even a midlife crisis.</p> 
			<p>A version of this story, the play Salome by Oscar Wilde (a modernist writer) imposes that Salome wanted John to die.</p> 
			<p><b>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salome_(play)
				">Wikipedia:</a></b> Wilde’s play Salome is the distortion of the Biblical story through the creation of Salome as a victim and victimiser. She is the incarnation of seductive lust and manipulative power. Salome is the object of lust and perverted desire leading to her twisted obsession in the beheading of John the Baptist.</p> 
			<p>When John the Baptist refused her advances, she drove Herod to his execution and celebrated by kissing John’s severed head. This version implies that the narrator of The Love Song had once resisted temptation, or rejected someone’s advances, and now foresees the consequences of that decision.</p>
