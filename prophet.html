			<p><b>What Happened to John the Baptist's Head?</b></p>
			<p>From <a href="http://globalchristiancenter.com/christian-living/lesser-known-bible-people/31297-what-happened-to-john-the-baptists-head">globalchristiancenter</a></p>
			<p>John the Baptist was the son of a Priest, a Cohen.</p>
			<p>His father was Zachariah, so his proper name was not ‘John the Baptist', but Johanan Bar Zachariah Cohen.</p>
			<p>The Gospel of Mark 6:17-28 gives us this account:</p>
			<p>"For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; for he had married her.  Because John had said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."  Therefore Herodias held it against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not; for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and he protected him. And when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. Then an opportune day came when Herod on his birthday gave a feast for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee. And when Herodias' daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you." He also swore to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom." So she went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptist!" Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter." And the king was exceedingly sorry; yet, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he did not want to refuse her. Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in prison, brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother."</p>
