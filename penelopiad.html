        		<h1>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.</h1>
			<h3>by T.S. Eliot</h3>
			<h2>Illuminated Text by Manasvi Vanama and Jareeat Purnava</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Line 13: <i><b>"And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker."</b></i><p>
			<p>by Jareeat</p>
			<br>
      <p>The Eternal Footman is generally thought to symbolize Death, a metaphysical being that greets souls of the dead as they enter the other side. Charon is a popular example of this scenario, as pointed out here: a Greek deity that ferries the souls from the land of the living to the Underworld to meet their ultimate fate in the afterlife.</p> 

The Penelopiad features characters living in this sort of afterlife, after having been presumably ferried across the River Styx. 

Dante's <i>Inferno</i> was a section of <i>The Divine Comedy</i> (part of which is featured in the first stanza of this poem), in which the protagonist (Dante himself) is taken on a journey through hell guided by the poet Virgil. The ferryman, Charon, takes Virgil and Dante across the river Acheron and delivers them to hell before the journey begins. The narrator of the Love Song may be alluding to this event, foreseeing that his descent into hell is imminent as he has already met with the "eternal footman", in this case, Charon.

This connection to the Penelopiad is interesting because Penelope ultimately ends up in the fields of Asphodel, a place frequently depicted as an area of neutrality (similar to Purgatory). In it, souls who did nothing bad nor great in their lives were sent to live in solitude. (However, in the Penelopiad, it is possible for souls to be born and live again, but Penelope chooses not to.) As the narrator recounts that he is nothing like a prophet, or Prince Hamlet (a Shakespearean tragic hero), while admitting he has fasted and prayed, it can be said that at this point in his life, he is in some metaphorical fields of Asphodel, where he is left to do nothing but wallow in his own misery. 

In Purgatory, souls are usually purified before entering Heaven, receiving temporary punishment for their sins. However, from a Dante angle, this process is backwards: the narrator, in the metaphorical Purgatory, will soon be sent to Hell instead of Heaven.
