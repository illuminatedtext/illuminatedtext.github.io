			<p><i><b>"And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker."</b></i><p>
			<br>
			<p>Acquainted with the Night</p>
			<p>by Robert Frost</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have been one acquainted with the night.</p>
			<p>I have walked out in rainâ€”and back in rain.</p>
			<p>I have outwalked the furthest city light.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have looked down the saddest city lane.</p>
			<p>I have passed by the watchman on his beat</p>
			<p>And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet</p>
			<p>When far away an interrupted cry</p>
			<p>Came over houses from another street,</p>
			<br>
			<p>But not to call me back or say good-bye;</p>
			<p>And further still at an unearthly height,</p>
			<p>One luminary clock against the sky</p>
			<br>
			<p>Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.</p>
			<p> I have been one acquainted with the night.</p>
