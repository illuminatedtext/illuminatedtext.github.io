			<p><b>Acquainted with the Night</b></p>
			<p>by Robert Frost</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have been one acquainted with the night.</p>
			<p>I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.</p>
			<p>I have outwalked the furthest city light.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have looked down the saddest city lane.</p>
			<p>I have passed by the watchman on his beat</p>
			<p>And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet</p>
			<p>When far away an interrupted cry</p>
			<p>Came over houses from another street,</p>
			<br>
			<p>But not to call me back or say good-bye;</p>
			<p>And further still at an unearthly height,</p>
			<p>One luminary clock against the sky</p>
			<br>
			<p>Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.</p>
			<p> I have been one acquainted with the night.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Rationale</p>
			<p>This Modernist poem by Robert Frost (published 1928), at a glance, speaks about someone feeling isolated from the world around them. They describe the city scenery around them, which should be bustling with activity, but in the dead of night seems haunting, vast and endless.</p> 

			<p>The narrator’s “acquaintance with the night” can be compared to that of the “eternal footman” from The Love Song. The “eternal footman” can be seen as an allusion to Death, a metaphysical being that welcomes souls to the other side after they have met their ultimate ending. The narrator from The Love Song foresees that his entrance into the afterlife will humour even Death itself, perhaps at the complete misery and isolation the narrator had lived his life.</p> 

			<p>In Acquainted with the Night, the narrator faces a similar situation where they compare their isolation to their relationship with the night. Too long without love, the narrator sadly recognizes that the “interrupted cry” is not for them, as they believe there is no one left to attend to them in their world.</p> 

			<p>Both poems, featuring narrators stricken with misery, are representative of the disillusionment the Modern hero faces in their journey. Disheartened and unsatisfied with their progress, they have even given up seeking light in a world of darkness and submitted completely to the isolation within themselves.</p> 

			<p>It is also worth mentioning that Acquainted with the Night is written in <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/terza-rima-poetic-term">terza rima</a>, a poetic form which follows the rhyme scheme ABA BCB CDC DED AA. It was invented by Dante Alighieri, writer of the epic poem <i>The Divine Comedy</i>, part of which is featured in the first stanza of The Love Song.</p> 
			<p>Also, Dante's <i>Inferno</i> was a section of <i>The Divine Comedy</i>, in which the protagonist (Dante himself) is taken on a journey through hell guided by the poet Virgil. The ferryman, Charon, takes Virgil and Dante across the river Acheron and delivers them to hell before the journey begins. The narrator of the Love Song may be alluding to this event, forseeing that his descent into hell is imminent as he has already met with the "eternal footman", in this case, Charon.</p>
